Titanic data for the classification of survivors and non-survivors with machine learning 
A. Background
Titanic was the largest passenger ship ever made, collided with an iceberg on april 15,1912. It almost killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers. The major reason for loss of life was insufficient life boats but few people survived.
Here, we are analysing with a sample of 1309 observations to understand more about the survivability of the passengers travelled.


B. Objective
Build a predictive model that answers the question: “What sorts of people were more likely to survive?”
The project explores s 4 methods (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, kNN and Decision Trees), and identifies the best method.

Modified variables and the whole process is explained in the file - "Classifiers-git.pdf"
